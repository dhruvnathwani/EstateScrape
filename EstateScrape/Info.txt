This was a SAAS project that I built out in order to teach myself more about payment authentication with the stripe API, monetizing a script, and standing up a self serving backend service.

The backend was hosted on heroku and allowed a user to scrape Zillow listings for a zip code, city, or county (priced accordingly by size). It would then ingest all of the data, and email the user an excel sheet of all of the houses for sale in the area ranked by cash on cash return.

Though this was primarily an educational project, I did use it in my house search, and it actually helped me ultimately purchase a house that was undervalued by the market, but ranked highly on my output!
